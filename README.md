There are so many plugins out there. Knowing which ones to choose can be really hard. Let us help.

## Description ##

With over 45,000 plugins in the repo it can be hard for new users to know where to start. Yeah there is search but what if you don’t know what you are looking for. What better plugins recommendations does 

The only purpose of this plugin is to help WordPress users find the plugins they need. There is no branding or ads. It’s integrated perfectly into Plugin -> New screen.

Saying that these are the "best" WordPress plugins isn't really helpful. Best is so subjective. I thought it would help if you knew the criteria I used in selecting these plugins, so I've included it below. I'm also trying to only include plugins that I think the majority of people will use. There are definitely some great niche plugins that I think are wonderful but not useful enough for everyone to include.

**Here is the criteria I used:**

* Price (Free)
* Numbers of users
* Average Rating
* Last Updated
* Support Given

## Installation ##

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
